The course starts with the basics. I'll show you the tips and tricks to work effortlessly with web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Once you're doing that in your sleep, I'll show you how to build your own responsive websites using more advanced techniques such as iQuery PHP, MySQL and Twitter Bootstrap.

By then you'll be developing blogs and eCommerce sites with Wordpress, and learn intelligent ways to add dynamic content, using APls to connect to sites such as Google Maps and Facebook.
